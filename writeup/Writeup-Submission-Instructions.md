# Writeup Submission Instructions

Each participating team should describe their methods and algorithms that they have built in their final submission to the Syn-ISS Challenge 2023. 
**A method write-up must be completed for your final submission to be scored.**

## Preparing the writeup

The writeup should be no more than 4 pages in length using the LNCS format. Details about the [LNCS format are here](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). Please refer to the [write-up guidelines](writeup-guidelines.md) provided.

## Submitting writeup to Synapse

Your writeup submission must include the following files inside a file archive. 
1. PDF version of writeup

2. Source file of writeup
    
    This is the file or set of files you used to compile or generate your PDF file. For example, the `.docx` file from Microsoft Word or Google Docs. If you have multiple files then submit a file archive with a `.zip` file extension. 

### Create a Synapse project
The same project that has been created for submitting the Docker image should be used to submit your writeup files. Please refer to the [Creating a Synapse project section](../docker/Docker-Submission-Instructions.md#create-a-synapse-project) for those instructions. Please make sure that you have this before proceeding further. 

### Naming the writeup files

The writeup files must be named using the following format.
```
syniss-<team-name>.<file-extension>
```
where,<br>
`team-name` is the team abbreviation that was provided during registration,<br>
`file-extension` is the appropriate file extension, e.g., `pdf`, `.docx`, `zip`, etc.<br>

### Uploading the writeup files

The writeup files that you have prepared for submission should be uploaded to your Synapse project. Please follow the instructions on [uploading a file using the Synapse UI](https://help.synapse.org/docs/Uploading-and-Organizing-Data.2002846338.html#UploadingandOrganizingData-QuickOverview:UploadingaFile(viatheSynapseUI)).

3. Select the option: `I am submitting as an individual`.<br>
Ignore the team submission option even though you are part of a team. The organizers have the information about the team through the email registration process. 

### Submitting new version of files
Please follow these instructions to submit new versions until the submission deadline. Please maintain the same file naming as previous submissions. DO NOT change the name or add any suffixes like `_v2`. Synapse takes care of maintaining a version history for each file within your Synapse project. 

Thank you!
